# Learning Strategy

## Recommended Approach:

### Phase 1: Master Basics (4-6 weeks)
- Focus on patterns 1-8
- Solve 5 problems per pattern
- Build strong foundation
- Understand time/space complexity

### Phase 2: Tackle Medium (6-8 weeks)
- Focus on patterns 9-23
- Practice 5 problems per pattern
- Start mixing patterns
- Begin timing yourself

### Phase 3: Conquer Hard (4-6 weeks)
- Focus on patterns 24-35
- Solve complex multi-pattern problems
- Optimize solutions
- Practice under interview conditions

## Study Tips:

1. **Understand the Pattern** - Don't just memorize solutions
2. **Practice Consistently** - Solve 2-3 problems daily
3. **Review Regularly** - Revisit solved problems weekly
4. **Time Yourself** - Practice with a 45-minute limit
5. **Code Without IDE** - Use whiteboard or paper
6. **Explain Your Solution** - Practice talking through your approach
7. **Focus on Edge Cases** - Test with empty inputs, single elements, large inputs
8. **Optimize** - Always think about better time/space complexity

## Pattern Recognition Cheat Sheet:

- **Sorted Array** → Binary Search
- **Find Pair/Triplet** → Two Pointers / Hashing
- **Subarray/Substring** → Sliding Window
- **Tree Level-by-Level** → BFS
- **All Combinations** → Backtracking
- **Shortest Path** → BFS/Dijkstra
